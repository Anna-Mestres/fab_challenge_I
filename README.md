# Fab Academy Challenge I

#### By [José Hirmas](https://jose-hirmas.github.io/mdefportafolio/fab%20academy/Challenges/), [Borbala Moravcsik](https://borbalamoravcsik.github.io/mdef-borka/Fabacademy-challenge1.html) & [Anna Mestres](https://anna-mestres.github.io/anna.mestres/fab/c1.html)


>Goal:
To create a participatory game for sharing realities and connect them.


## CREUAR *(cross)*

*Elle creu la corda per a que tots puguem passar. (they cross the rope for let all of us pass)*
“Creu” is a cross and  to cross, but it is also believing. So we created this metaphor to understand the value of the name.

**“Creu” in kids as agents of change that can transform the world.**

### What is this game?

It is a game to shape our common realities, to connect and to be able to express ourselves to each other. To create those bridges that separate us. It is also a game of mobility and agility. We have to listen and communicate to be aware of the situation around us.

Imagine this scenario:

*Kids formulating questions and answering about important topics for the future, generating reflection and new points of view. All this is happening as part of the game where shapes and ropes are the triggers for participation. Everyone has the chance to formulate a question and to respond to an answer, making the shapes go from one rope to another.*

### Why this game?

Democratizing participation is a big challenge when imagining and co-creating the future(s). The decisions that we make as society are commonly led by the same people, generating a misunderstanding of issues and a lack of holistic wellbeing.

This game **empowers kids as agents of change**, towards participation on important topics for better futures. **Participation** is not only a way of responding, but also a way of asking the right questions about what life, relationships, society, nature, tech means.

Trying to connect body movement and the freedom of speech as a powerful participation tool, we are enabling a new way of communication between humans.

You can´t reach your goal without communicating and acting at the same time.

### Theoretical rules for playing


1. The goal of the game is to have the same shape of figures in each rope.
2. Everyone playing must ask a question or /and respond and answer (everyone has to participate).
3. When answering a question you can move one figure from one rope to another, or just drop it out.
4. You only win when everyone wins.


### Preparation


1. Open the box - place the sides of the box on the ground and step on them - you ask a question based on the topic you are standing on.
2. Hold 2 ropes in your hands.
3. Place any amount of shapes on the ropes, just make sure they are mixed.


### Play

1. Form a question based on your [**topic**](https://github.com/Anna-Mestres/fab_challenge_I#topics-of-references).
2. Decide which rope you want to fill up with it’s shapes and ask the question from people who has those shapes.
3. Answer the question with a memory, a fact or an emotion - with the answer type of the shape you have chosen.

#### Topics of references

* Society (Friends, family and people around
* Nature and environment
* Your City
* Internet and Social Media (communication technology)
* Who are You (your identity)
* Languages

## Sharing Ideas and Interest

We are a dispersed group from different cultures and different backgrounds. In order to initiate a starting point we have shared our personal and coercive interests with each other on the basis of the template that fabacademy has provided us with in the miro.

![Areas of interest](images/briefing.png)
*Areas of interest*

Our focus is on connection, education, cooperation and understanding between different generations. To be able to see other points of view. As well as the interaction of play itself, the main tool used by children as a bridge between the real world and their fantasy world. For this reason we decided to focus on creating a participatory game for sharing realities and connect them.

## Make the repository

Once we focused on the topic, we created a common repository to upload all the files, so that all the research on this game can be an open resource. In addition, in order to be able to work together more comfortably and so that we can all edit all the documents, we use the fork programme.

## Brainstorming

Knowing the topic (participatory game for sharing realities and connect them) we focused on how we could create that sharing of ideas, which so ancestrally unites us; communication. This can be in many ways; verbal, non-verbal, written, with legs, sign language, spoken, movements, looks, etc.

We decided to investigate currently existing collaborative games that require communication as a secondary or not so commonly played function, such as twister or mime. As well as current game designers or game design companies.   

![brainstorming](images/brainstorming.png)
*state of art*

## Prototype 1

After all this process, we start sharing ideas that collapse all our objectives. To further our ideology, instead of closing in on ourselves, we discussed all the ideas floating around in our heads. And by sharing, we made our ideas bigger. From this came the metaphor of connecting with threads, as in asking questions, while we are connected. And taking others into account. We also flowed with the idea that it is not a competition against each other, but that if one loses we all lose. That team cooperation. All those values that in the end are essential to the ethics of humanity.

![drafts](images/drafts.jpg)
*first drafts*

We finally arrived at the first idea of Creuar el Pont. We had many doubts about the shape of the pieces and the mechanism of the game itself, as well as the role of the questions and how to define it correctly for a better understanding. But what we had to figure out correctly was whether the mechanism of passing the pieces worked. For this reason we made a simple prototype with post-it notes and string, and tested it.

![prototype 1](images/prototype1.gif)
*frist prototype*

## First drawings

After understanding what could work, we started by looking a bit at the different shapes the pieces could have. Also, discuss a bit more about the functions of the roles between the answers and the questions correlated with the shapes or colours.

*first drafts and drawings*

## Prototype 2

In order to be able to design the game correctly, the rules of the game must be implemented and also why. There are some values that we want to be implemented, such as; respect, cooperation, fairness, understanding, above all.
We want to make the game as free as possible, in that each group can create new rules or play as they see fit. In the end, play is imagination.

For this reason, an imagination exercise was carried out on the game in order to rationalise the rules and key aspects.

![test prototype 2](images/prototype2.gif)

After the prototype, we have reached the conclusion of the [rules](https://github.com/Anna-Mestres/fab_challenge_I#how-to-play) to be followed, as well as of the possible [topic](https://github.com/Anna-Mestres/fab_challenge_I#topics-of-references) to be chosen.

## Materials and Digital Fabrication

The materials that we choose to use for create the game are:
  * Rope (depending on the size of the parts, if these are large the string is better to be large to improve mobility.)
  * Sprays for colorize (another type of paint can be used if the material is different, to taste.)
  * Cardboard 4 mm for the prototypes
  * MDF 3mm (two boards of 1000 x 600 mm)
    ![Our materials](images/materials.jpg)
    *Materials that we used*

The Digital Fabrication that we use are:

  * Laser cut (Trotec Speedy 400)
  * Rhino (Rhino 5 is the version to keep the files for make work the laser machine in this case)
  * Illustrator (Inskcape it's open resource it could be used too)
    ![Our tools](images/tools.jpg)
    *Tools that we use*


## Prototype 3

Once we got the files done, we went to cut it with the laser so we could test them.

Trotec Speedy 400 laser for cutting the 4 mm cardboard.
With the parameters:
  * Power : 40
  * Speed : 1
  * Frequency : 1000

![Laser prototype 3](images/laser3.jpeg)
*Laser cut with the third prototype*

We separated the parts between them and retouched them a little to improve their performance. And we also test it to make sure everything works properly.

![retouch prototype 3](images/prototype3.gif)
*testing and retouching the third prototype*

There are two designs that do not work very well, so we will make some changes to be able to correct these errors and that all the parts are useful.

![test prototype 3](images/proto3.gif)
*retouching the third prototype*

## Prototype 4
The elements that were not working properly were then modified and cut again.
Trotec Speedy 400 laser for cutting the 3 mm MDF.
With the parameters:
  * Power : 55
  * Speed : 0.5
  * Frequency : 1000

![Laser prototype 4](images/prototype33.gif)
*Laser cutting prototype 4*

Since the lens was dirty, the cut wasn’t deep enough, and it didn’t finish cutting. He increased the force to 60 and cut himself again on top of it, but failed to cut definitively. So he ended up separating the pieces with a cutter.

![Cutter prototype 4](images/prototype4.jpg)
*Process with the cutter*

Some holes of the pieces the rope does not get to enter for this reason have had to sand.

![Sand prototype 4](images/sand.jpg)
*sanding process*

After this we paint the pieces.

![Painting prototype 4](images/paint2.jpg)
*Painting all the pieces*

We design the box to keep all the pieces together inside. We have used each side of the box to write the main conversation topics and instructions for use. We have used each side of the box to write the main conversation topics and instructions for use.

All faces will have a written theme but in one of them by the other band will be written instructions to optimize resources.

A piece has been designed that will go to the edge of each rope as a form of grip.

## Conclusion and Future development


We've chosen these materials because they're accessible to everyone and you can even give this DIY dynamic.
