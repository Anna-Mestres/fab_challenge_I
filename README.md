## Why this game?

Democratizing participation is a big challenge when imagining and co-creating the future(s). The decisions that we make as society are commonly led by the same people, generating a misunderstanding of issues and a lack of holistic wellbeing.

This game **empowers kids as agents of change**, towards participation on important topics for better futures. **Participation** is not only a way of responding, but also a way of asking the right questions about what life, relationships, society, nature, tech means.

Trying to connect body movement and the freedom of speech as a powerful participation tool, we are enabling a new way of communication between humans.

You can´t reach your goal without communicating and acting at the same time.


### Theoretical rules for playing


1. The goal of the game is to have the same shape of figures in each rope.

2. Everyone playing must ask a question or /and respond and answer (everyone has to participate).

3. When answering a question you can move one figure from one rope to another, or just drop it out.

4. You only win when everyone wins.


### Preparation


1. Open the box - place the sides of the box on the ground and step on them - you ask a question based on the topic you are standing on.

2. Hold 2 ropes in your hands.

3. Place any amount of shapes on the ropes, just make sure they are mixed.

### Play

1. Form a question based on your topic.
2. Decide which rope you want to fill up with it’s shapes and ask the question from people who has those shapes.
3. Answer the question with a memory, a fact or an emotion - with the answer type of the shape you have chosen.
